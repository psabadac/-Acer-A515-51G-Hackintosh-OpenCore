### Laptop configuration


- **Audio** : The Sound Card is `Realtek ALC255`, which is driven by `AppleALC` on `layout-id 30`.

- **CPU** : The CPU model is `i5-8250U` and XCPM power management is natively supported.
 - - XCPM and HWP are recommended to work together to reach better power management, by injecting `plugin-type=1` with `SSDT-XCPM`, and using `CPUFriend.kext`.

- **Graphics** : The iGPU is `Intel UHD Graphics 620`, and its enabled using `Ig-Platform-id=0x191E0000`.
- - The discrete dGPU is `NVIDIA GeForce MX150`, and it is disabled because macOS doesn't support optimus technology. Plus battery life is much improved.
- - The colour branding or corrupted color depth is fixed with Intel Skylake spoof and EDID fix.
- - Native brightness hotkey support using `DSDT.aml`.

- **Battery** : Battery Management using `SMCBatteryManager.kext`.

- **Backlight** : Native Brightness control using `SSDT-PNLF.aml`.

- **Ethernet** : Gigabit Ethernet using `RealtekRTL8111.kext`.

- **HDMI** : Working using `WhateverGreen.kext`.
